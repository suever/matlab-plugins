# MarkdownPanel
Control which displays markdown as HTML within a MATLAB control
 
------
This control utilizes the [Showdown javascript library][1] to convert
markdown into HTML and then uses MATLAB's own `uihtml` component to
display the resulting HTML.
 
It behaves like any other graphics object within MATLAB in that all
properties can either be set upon object construction
 
    h = MarkdownPanel('Parent', uifigure(), 'Content', '# Hello World!');
 
Or after object creation using the returned handle
 
    h = MarkdownPanel();
    h.Parent = uifigure();
    set(h, 'Position', [0, 0, 0.5, 0.5])
 
To set the actual Markdown content, use the `Content` property. You
can provide *either* a string, or a cell array of strings which will
automatically create a multi-line entry
    
    set(h, 'Content', '#Hello World')
    set(h, 'Content', {'#Hello World', 'This is a test...'})
  
You can use the `Options` property to modify options that are
specific to how Showdown renders the markdown. By default, we use all
of the default settings except that we enable support for tables.
  
    h.Options.tables = true;
  
The `Options` property is simply a struct where the fieldnames are
the option names and the value is the option value. You can modify
this struct to adjust an option.
  
    % Enable support for tasklists
    h.Options.taskslists = true
   
A complete list of options can be found in the [Showdown
documentation][1]
